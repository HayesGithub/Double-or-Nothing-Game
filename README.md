# Double-or-Nothing-Game
Simple coin flip game that allows users to bet money out of a given amount on coin flips. Depending on the outcome the user will either win or lose. If the user wins they will receive double the wager they placed, if they lose then they lose the amount of money that they placed on that coin flip. This java project was done for a final exam for ITS 250.
